# Introduction

A brief introduction/motivation for the problem at hand, relevant details about the data, additional relevant scientific information, and what is to be addressed.

Citation example:

citation within parenthesis [@tsa4]



# Methods

A discussion and justification of the methods you have used to analyze the data and how you went about analyzing the data. Don't forget to describe in some detail how and why the particular model was selected.


Do not include the R code inside the report unless it is absolutely necessary. If you think a code is absolutely important, you can create an additional section at the end of the report (Appendix) and print all the codes there (not the output). In the main report, keep important and relevant results only.

Don't do this

```{r,echo=TRUE}
acf1(soi)
```

Don't do this (unless you really want to print out the values)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
acf1(soi)
```

But do this

```{r, echo=FALSE,results='hide'}
acf1(soi)
```

## Subsection title

If you want to put any additional subsection, you may use this style.

# Results

A presentation of the results of your analysis. Interpretations should include a discussion of statistical versus practical import of the results.

# Discussion

A synopsis of your findings and any limitations your study may suffer from.
